            the most low-maintenance. Crew Cut Hairstyle. The crew cut is a 
            classic of men's hairstyles. French Crop. Pompadour. Side Part. 
            Spiky Hair. Taper Fade Haircut. High Taper Fade.Knowing the names 
           for different types of haircuts for men is invaluable when you’re

           you want is probably the most common reason guys get a bad cut. Fortunately,
